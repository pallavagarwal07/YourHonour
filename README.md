==========

A Kubernetes based, extremely easy to deploy programming judge. Right now, everything
is built specific to the IIT Kanpur network connection and the Vyomkesh Openstack cloud
setup for CSE. However, with a few changes, it should work with pretty much any arbitrary
setup of Kubernetes.

Once the functionality is complete, I will work on adding support for easy deployment
on any nodes. If you think you have suggestons, or if you are willing to contribute to
this project, I would be delighted to accept your pull request.
